### Summary
Homework 6 conecpts were easy to grab and build upon. Reason I say this is because it dealt with the front end of things. I added a public folder with 6 html. These 6 html included add, delete, index, list, update, and view. Each of them connect to the actual studentsever.js and it functionality. My student folder reamiend the same as it hold all my students.  I updated my studentsever.js so where a message of object object is not seen but the actual task message is shown instead. Overall, I enjoyed the project and picked up a few thigns from it.
